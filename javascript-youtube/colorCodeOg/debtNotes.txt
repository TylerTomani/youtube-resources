Technical Debt Notes

A running list of known quirks, workarounds, and areas to revisit when time allows.

1. Sidebar Hiding Quirk

ID: TD-001

Location: playPauseVideos-colorCode.js → togglePlayVidSize

Description: When interacting with video elements, calling togglePlayVidSize() toggles the sidebar’s .deactive class, which hides the sidebar unexpectedly in non-step/step-float contexts.

Current Behavior: Functions well as a feature for enlarging videos, but also causes unintended sidebar hiding.

Temporary Workaround: Keep this behavior for now since it's not critical and actually improves video focus.

Future Action:

Investigate event targets and how toggleBar() is triggered.

Add conditionals to only toggle the sidebar when a .step or .step-float ancestor is present.

Consider using element.closest('.step, .step-float') for scoping.

Add unit or manual tests to confirm stability.

TD-001: Sidebar Hiding Quirk

Location: playPauseVideos-colorCode.js → togglePlayVidSize

Description: Enlarging videos inadvertently toggles the sidebar’s .deactive class, hiding it in non-step/step-float contexts.

Current Behavior: This behavior enhances video focus but also causes an unintended sidebar hide when interacting with <video> elements outside core steps.

Temporary Workaround: Retain current functionality until core features are shipped.

Future Action:

Scope sidebar toggling by checking element.closest('.step, .step-float') before applying classes.

Refactor toggleImg and togglePlayVidSize to separate video enlargement from sidebar logic.

Write tests or manual reproduction steps to validate fixes.
